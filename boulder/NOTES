It is a huge undertaking trying to rewrite everything. So we need a simpler and 
more pragmatic strategy.

What do we want ?

- consolidate all grpc services into a single process.
- convert the single process into a library.

One big challenge at hand is heavy dependency on mariadb/mysql. Good thing here is
components already work with grpc client interfaces. So we only need to satisfy
core interfaces and the rest of the system will work.

So basically if we,

- Remove mariadb dependency (by porting sa to gorm). Technically maria db can still
be used by gorm but we really care about sqlite as a priority.

- Wrapping already existing grpc server implementation into grpc client interfaces
and importing them instead of binding them to external sockets.

All work now boils down to sa. Get rid of sa and the rest of the boulder fall into
place.

Why the library ?

Vince need to have custom acme2 features. Certificate issued to clients work  like
access tokens and  are tied to  site lifecycle . This will allow vince customers to 
dynamically provision sites the same way they provision https certificates for sites.

This needs deeper integration between boulder and vince.
