# Our privacy policy

All personal data is kept securely by us and thus protected from unauthorized access.

To use our services and enter into a contractual relationship, we collect:

- preexisting confirmed email address as inventory data
- organization name (optional)

Once an account has been provisioned by our system, entry of additional personal information becomes possible but is not required by any means:


- full name
- postal address
- organization / company name
- VAT number

The scope of such voluntarily provided data is to facilitate billing and administration on the side of our users and will only be used for receipt generation. We have no internal use of such data, nor do we ever disclose it with third parties. The voluntarily provided data is also subject to our strict privacy protection.

### Data Storage Period

The personal data shall be deleted no later than 30 days after termination of the contract, unless specific reasons to the contrary apply in an individual case. In case a customer objected to the amount of the charged fees, the accounting data may be stored until the objections are terminally clarified. Furthermore, inventory data can be stored for up to two years if the handling of a complaint and other reasons require this for an orderly settlement of the contract. Moreover the deletion of inventory and billing data may be omitted provided that legal regulations or the prosecution of claims require this. Order-related data and the addresses associated with the order are stored in respect to tax, contract and commercial law retention periods and erased at the end of those periods.


### Cookies

Beyond technical requirements for establishing a working session on our website, we do not use cookies or any form of tracking.
